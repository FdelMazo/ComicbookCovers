# ComicbookCovers
Webscraper for DC and Marvel Wikias to download CB covers.

Before getting started you must have installed BeautifulSoup and lxml. To do so write in the terminal:
	- $ apt-get install python3-bs4 or $ easy_install beautifulsoup4 or $ pip install beautifulsoup4
	- $ apt-get install python-lxml or $ easy_install lxml or $ pip install lxml
	
This easy and light program does the following:
	- Prompts you a character name or comicbook series
	- Asks which of the found would you like
	- Downloads every cover found in the wikia for that series
