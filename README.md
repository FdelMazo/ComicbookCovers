# ComicbookCovers
Webscraper for DC and Marvel Wikias to download CB covers.

Keep in mind, I don't encourage downloading several times in a short time span, as the wikias tend to get angry when you request them so many images at once.
Try to space out your downloads

This easy and light program does the following:
* Asks you a character name or comicbook series
* Asks which of the found series would you like
* Downloads every cover found in the wikia for that series

Windows users:
*Download the 1.0 release (under 'releases') and start (or extract) the executable.
*After that, just start the CoversDownloader.exe

Python users:
*Just download both "CoversDownloader.py" and "Wikias.py" and write 'python CoversDownloader.py'

Next up for the program is:
* Download per artist, regardless of the company
* More wikia providers (Image, IDW, etc)
* GUI
* More OS executables
