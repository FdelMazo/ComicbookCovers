# ComicbookCovers
Webscraper for DC and Marvel Wikias to download CB covers.

It requires pip, a python package installer that comes by default since python 3.4. But if you dont have it: https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py

If requirements aren't met (subliminal, requests, beautifulsoup4, lxml) first time it must be run in admin/sudo

This easy and light program does the following:
* Prompts you a character name or comicbook series
* Asks which of the found series would you like
* Downloads every cover found in the wikia for that series
